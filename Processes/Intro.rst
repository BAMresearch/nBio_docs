Introduction
============

TOPAS-nBio facilitates the use of the physical and chemical processes available in Geant4-DNA toolkit.
Additional capabilities are also provided that allows: 
 1. The customization of physical models involved in the physics list.
 2. The use of Geant4-DNA physics per region.
 3. The use of a variance reduction technique.
 4. Reconfiguration of parameters for the physico-chemical stages.
 5. Explicit transport and visualization of the chemical species in the chemical stage.

Finally, several examples are provided to retrieve the spatio-temporal information of the physical and 
chemical tracks in different geometrical components, e.g. via particle tuple or single and double 
strand breaks.
