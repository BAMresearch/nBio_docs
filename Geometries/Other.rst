Other models
============
Recent experimental evidence is challenging the DNA-centric model of radiobiology and suggesting the full effect of radiation may not be initiated from DNA damage exclusively. Experiments in which the cytoplasm is irradiated, while the nucleus is spared, suggest that radiation induced damage in extra-nuclear cell structures may also be of importance for developing a comprehensive model of the cellular response to radiation. Some targets, other than DNA, are also included in TOPAS-nBio.

Membranes

A lipid bilayer is created in TOPAS-nBio consisting of two hydrophilic heads, each a sphere of radius ~2 nm, and a tail region consisting of a cylinder of radius ~1 nm and length of ~2 nm. The total thickness of the membrane is between 7 - 10 nm. All dimensions are changeable parameters::

  d:Ge/MyCell/LipidHeadRadius=1. nm
  d:Ge/MyCell/LipidTailHalfLength=3. nm
  d:Ge/MyCell/LipidTailRadius=0.5 nm

The membrane can be formed as a ring, sphere or a layer generated by the base elements i.e. the lipid unit::

  s:Ge/MyCell/Type="TsMembraneLayer"

  s:Ge/MyCell/Type="TsMembraneRing"

  s:Ge/MyCell/Type="TsIonChannels"

For the ring geometry the number of lipids forming the ring should be specified::

  i:Ge/MyCell/NumberOfLipids=50

Transmembrane proteins, which represent ion channels or communication proteins can also be included in the membrane layers. Ion channels are formed by three or more protein subunits (modeled as cylinders) arranged in a circle within the membrane. Communication proteins are modeled as a single cylinder. Channels may also be formed by a single cylinder with a hole drilled through its middle::

  s:Ge/MyCell/Type="TsMembraneLayer"
  s:Ge/MyCell/Type="TsMembraneRing"
  s:Ge/MyCell/Type="TsIonChannels"

Mitochondria
------------
Mitochondria are the only sites of extra-nuclear DNA in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) in humans contains ~ 16569 bps encoding 37 genes and unlike nuclear DNA, which is linear, mt-DNA is circular.
Mitochondria are modeled as ellipsoids. Users need to specify the semi-axis lengths (a, b and c) of the ellipsoid. mt-DNA may be included in the model, modeled as either a circular or non-circular plasmid::

  s:Ge/MyOrganelle/Type="TsMito"
  d:Ge/MyOrganelle/a=0.5 um
  d:Ge/MyOrganelle/b=0.3 um
  d:Ge/MyOrganelle/c=0.9 um
  


Proteins
--------
The `protein data bank`_ (PDB) contains over 130,000 biological macromolecular 3D structures, including proteins and nucleic acids. Many of these proteins are essential to normal cellular function, and precise modeling of the spatial distribution in a realistic molecular model can aid in extending our understanding of the effect of radiation.
