Cells

A common end point of measurement for cells cultured in vitro in radiobiology is the reproductive death of a cell. A cell survival curve describes the relationship between the radiation dose and the proportion of cells that survive. Survival, however, does not necessarily refer to cell death (apoptosis) but can refer to a multitude of other conditions. For non-proliferating cells (e.g., differentiated cells such as neurons), survival can be defined as the loss of a specific function (e.g., ability to form a working synaptic connection), while for proliferating cells (e.g., intestinal epithelium) survival may be defined as the loss of the ability to divide and produce new cells. 

Monte Carlo simulations in a single cell model can provide insight into the distribution of dose in the entire cell or a specific sub-region of the cell (e.g., the cell nucleus). This may be correlated with experimental measurements of the loss of a specific function or cell apoptosis. Single cell models can also form the geometric boundary for more complex studies, for example, calculating the energy deposited in other sub-cellular components (e.g., organelles, cell membranes) or investigating DNA damage in the nucleus. TOPAS-nBio provides users with a unique framework for designing multiple cell types and the option of including organelle sub-components. Below we outline some of the cells available in TOPAS-nBio by shape.
